## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   Create, read, update, and delete invoices
-   Receive form validations when trying to create/edit an invoice
-   Save draft invoices, and mark pending invoices as paid
-   Filter invoices by status (draft/pending/paid)
-   Toggle light and dark mode
-   **Bonus**: Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)
